# Word Counter App

Simple word counter app to be used in larger projects. Counts words entered in a text field in real-time.

## Usage

To run: 

```bash
npm init
npm run dev
How It Works
The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It consists of two main components:
```
InputArea: This component handles the user input and updates the state in real-time as the user types or pastes text.

ResultDisplay: This component displays the word count based on the input provided in the InputArea.
