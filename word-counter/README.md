# Word Counter App

This is a simple word counter app designed to be used as a component in larger projects. It allows users to count the number of words entered in a text field in real-time.

## Usage

To use this Word Counter App, follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project with `npm`:

```bash
npm init
```

2. Run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It consists of two main components:

1. **InputArea**: This component handles the user input and updates the state in real-time as the user types or pastes text.

2. **ResultDisplay**: This component displays the word count based on the input provided in the `InputArea`.
